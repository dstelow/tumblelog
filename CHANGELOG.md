## [3.0.0] - 2019-10-05

This version adds the ability to create non-blog pages, for example an *about* page, and a *subscription page*. It should even be possible to create a micro site this way, without a blog. The syntax for the non-blog page marker is as follows:

```
@PAGE[LABEL] YYYY-MM-DD TITLE
```

With:

 - PAGE - the filename of the page without the `.html` extension
 - LABEL - the label of the page
 - YYYY-MM-DD - the date the page was updated
 - TITLE - The title of the page

For example:

```
@subscribe[subscribe] 2019-10-05 Subscribe
```

If the date is immediately followed by an exclamation mark the date is also shown on the generated HTML page.

Page titels are no longer generated by gluing the blog name and the title together; if you want the blog name in the HTML you have to add it to the template.

## [2.5.0] - 2019-10-02

Add an RSS feed

 - Add description option (required)
 - Deprecate `feed-url` template variable
 - Add `rss-feed-url`, `json-feed-url`, and `description` template variables

## [2.1.1] - 2019-09-26

The file _tumblelog.scss has been slightly reorganised.

## [2.1.0] - 2019-09-24

This update removes one "nav element with no heading" remark in the W3C
Markup Validation Service in outline mode.

Note that this means that you have to change the template you use for your blog and maybe the CSS if you modified `_tumblelog.scss`.

See [Nav Element with no Heading](http://johnbokma.com/blog/2019/09/24/nav-element-with-no-heading.html) for an explanation and what to change in your template.

## [2.0.1] - 2019-09-18

It turned out that version 2.0.0 of tumblelog has a small bug: if you use an older version of the CommonMark Perl module the constant OPT_UNSAFE is not defined. So I added some code that checks if this constant exists and if not adds it.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-09-17

Note that images with text following immediately are rendered as a
figure with the text in a figcaption element. This means that:

```
![Alt text](cat.jpg)
Photo of a cat.
```

is rendered as HTML as follows:

```
<figure>
<img alt="Alt text" src="cat.jpg" />
<figcaption>
Photo of a cat.
</figcaption>
</figure>
```

This allows for CSS styling of both the image and the caption.
